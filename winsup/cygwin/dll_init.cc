/* Look for a dll based on the full path.

   CV, 2012-03-04: Per MSDN, If a DLL with the same module name is already
   loaded in memory, the system uses the loaded DLL, no matter which directory
   it is in. The system does not search for the DLL.  See
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

   On 2012-02-08 I interpreted "module name" as "basename".  So the assumption
   was that the Windows Loader does not load another DLL with the same basename,
   if one such DLL is already loaded.  Consequentially I changed the code so
   that DLLs are only compared by basename.

   This assumption was obviously wrong, as the perl dynaloader proves.  It
   loads multiple DLLs with the same basename into memory, just from different
   locations.  This mechanism is broken when only comparing basenames in the
   below code.

   However, the original problem reported on 2012-02-07 was a result of
   a subtil difference between the paths returned by different calls to
   GetModuleFileNameW: Sometimes the path is a plain DOS path, sometimes
   it's preceeded by the long pathname prefix "\\?\".

   So I reverted the original change from 2012-02-08 and only applied the
   following fix: Check if the path is preceeded by a long pathname prefix,
   and, if so, drop it forthwith so that subsequent full path comparisons
   work as expected.

   At least that was the original idea.  In fact there are two case, linked
   and runtime loaded DLLs, which have to be distinguished:

   - Linked DLLs are loaded by only specifying the basename of the DLL and
     searching it using the system DLL search order as given in the
     aforementioned MSDN URL.

   - Runtime loaded DLLs are specified with the full path since that's how
     dlopen works.

   In effect, we have to be careful not to mix linked and loaded DLLs.
   For more info how this gets accomplished, see the comments at the start
   of dll_list::alloc, as well as the comment preceeding the definition of
   the in_load_after_fork bool later in the file. */

  /* Broken DLLs built against Cygwin versions 1.7.0-49 up to 1.7.0-57
     override the cxx_malloc pointer in their DLL initialization code,
     when loaded either statically or dynamically.  Because this leaves
     a stale pointer into demapped memory space if the DLL is unloaded
     by a call to dlclose, we prevent this happening for dynamically
     loaded DLLs in dlopen by saving and restoring cxx_malloc around
     the call to LoadLibrary, which invokes the DLL's startup sequence.
     Modern DLLs won't even attempt to override the pointer when loaded
     statically, but will write their overrides directly into the
     struct it points to.  With all modern DLLs, this will remain the
     default_cygwin_cxx_malloc struct in cxx.cc, but if any broken DLLs
     are in the mix they will have overridden the pointer and subsequent
     overrides will go into their embedded cxx_malloc structs.  This is
     almost certainly not a problem as they can never be unloaded, but
     if we ever did want to do anything about it, we could check here to
     see if the pointer had been altered in the early parts of the DLL's
     startup, and if so copy back the new overrides and reset it here.
     However, that's just a note for the record; at the moment, we can't
     see any need to worry about this happening.  */
